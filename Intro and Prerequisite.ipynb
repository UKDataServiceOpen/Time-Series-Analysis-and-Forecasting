Time series analysis and forecasting are among the most common quantitative techniques employed by businesses and researchers. Largely used in big data, these methods are used to identify trends, clean your data, and to predict the future. This workshop begins by exploring the underlying concepts and components of time series analysis, then moves on to a code demonstration that uses open-sourced police recorded crime statistics to visually explore these components. Participants are invited to work alongside the code demonstration to gain hands-on and practical skills.\n",

                "At a more technical level we will be exploring the statistical components that make up a time series, such as the level, trend, seasonality and noise. We will also explore some functions that can be used to examine stationarity and the functions to apply differencing technique. Finally, a quick example of an S/ARIMA model will be demonstrated using some open sourced crime data from the R package *crimedata*. \n",
